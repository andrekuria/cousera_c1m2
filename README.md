This is my assignment on week 2 of Introduction to Embedded Systems offered at Coursera by the University of Colorado Boulder.

The file include contains .h files that would be used by the source files using the -I tag. 

SCR contains all the files used by both native and cross compiler and also the sources.mk file holds the files to each platform, which is then included into our main makefile.
